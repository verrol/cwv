# Section 03 Exercise 03 - Declaring and Using Slices

## Create a go program which does the following

### TODO 1

1. Declares an array of 10 to 20 elements of type float64
   - use a const for the array size
2. Initialize a Slice from the Array, such that the Slice has the same length as the Array.
    - NOTE: The 'ONLY' purpose of the Array is to initialize the Slice in the program. Don't use the Array in any other part of the program.

### TODO 2

1. Using the slice, store random currency values using 'input.GetRandFloat()'.
    - TIP:
        - See Section 02 - Lecture 10 for the currency type
        - Use a 'for' loop to initialize your array values
        - The 'input' package is github.com/striversity/glft/shared/input and was covered in Sec01-Lec12.

### TODO 3

1. Use the slice to calculate total, max, min, avg
