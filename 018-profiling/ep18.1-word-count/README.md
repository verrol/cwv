# Word Count

## TODO 1 - Count the occurrence of each _word_ in one or more text files

### Requirements

1. The filename(s) is/are passed as an argument to the program.
2. For each file, read all the data and count each occurrence of all words.
3. You will also need *strings.Split()* and *strings.TrimSpace()*, if you are reading by line.
    - TIP: Go standard package _bufio_ provides line and word scanner, see _bufio.Scanner()_.
