I have provided several packages that you will need for this exercise. Find documenation for the package here: https://godoc.org/github.com/striversity/glft/shared/

## TODO 1

Write a Golang program which meets the following requirements:

1. Get the user and ask them for their name. *HINT* Use the 'input' package 'input.ReadString()' function.
2. Print the user's name with a message.
3. Inform the user of the current date and time using 'cal.DateNow()' and 'cal.TimeNow()'.
