# Section 02 - Exercise 06

Given the function 'getUserAge()', don't worry about how it is implemented, write a program that does the following:

    * _NOTE_: I have provided the function 'getUserAge()', which gets the user's age.

Complete the program using the value in the variable  'userAge'.

## TODO 1 - Use the switch statement to print the following appropriate message

  1. printing "You are too young to sign up." if 'userAge' is less than or equal to 16,
  2. printing "Come back when you are 18.", if 'userAge' is equal to 17
  3. printing "Welcome, you are old enough to sign up!", if 'userAge' is greater than or equal to 18

## TODO 2 - Run the program a few times to see different results
