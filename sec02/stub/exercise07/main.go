TODO 1 - calculate the sum of ODD nubmers between 1 to 10001
HINT: Use the modulo operator: 
	https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic

ODD numbers  -> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, .... 9999, 10001
Result should be: 25010001

TODO 2 - calculate the 'integer' average of all nubmers from 1 to 10001,
excluding the nubmers: 
   10, 19, 21, 39, 309, 431, 643, 942, 1209, 7981, 8888, 9910
Result should be: 5003
