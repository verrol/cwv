# Go Language for Tourists

## Code Examples and Exercises

### Organization

There are two directories provided for each chapter, *solution* and *exercise*.

As you may expect, the *solution* directory contains the completed solution for each exercise. The *exercise* directory contains stubbed out or partially written examples for you to complete.

For each *exercise*, you will find one or more _TODO_ comments. The _TODO_ comment explains the exercise and what you need to complete.

Some *exercies* have several _TODOs_. You can tell what to do first by the number associated with the _TODOs_. For example, _TODO 1_ for _TODO 2_.

### Shared Package

There is a *shared* pacakge with some reusable code for your exercies. If you are *NOT* using Go modules, then you will need to install the packages before you can run the exercises.

* To install the *shared* packages:
1. Open a command prompt
2. Type:

```zsh
go get github.com/striversity/glft/shared
```
