> In computer science, the dining philosophers problem is an example problem often used in concurrent algorithm design to illustrate synchronization issues and techniques for resolving them. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

## TODO - Implement a golang application illustrating 'Arbitrator solution'

In the 'Abritrator solution' described in Wikipedia, only 1 philosopher can eat at a time, even when 2 forks are available. Modify the 'Arbitrator solution' described on Wikipedia such that if 2 forks are available, a philosopher can eat. Which means, your should should demonstrate that two philosophers can eat at the same time.
