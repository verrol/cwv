# Section 02 - Exercise 07

Write a program that calculates the sum of ODD nubmers between 1 to 10001.

## TODO 1

Calculate the sum of ODD nubmers between 1 to 10001

    * HINT: Use the modulo operator: https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modarithmetic/a/what-is-modular-arithmetic

ODD numbers  -> 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, .... 9999, 10001

The result should be 25010001.

### REQUIREMENTS

1. You *must* use 'continue' in at least one of your solutions.

## TODO 2

Calculate the 'integer' average of all nubmers from 1 to 10001, excluding the nubmers: 
   10, 19, 21, 39, 309, 431, 643, 942, 1209, 7981, 8888, 9910
Result should be: 5003
